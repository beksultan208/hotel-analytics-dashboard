# Hotel Analytics Dashboard (2018–2020)

This is my data analytics project about hotel bookings from **2018 to 2020**.  
I used **SQL + Excel + Power BI** to calculate revenue and build a dashboard.

## 📌 Goal of the Project
The main goal is to analyze hotel performance and revenue.

I wanted to answer questions like:
- How much revenue hotels made in 2018–2020?
- Which year had the best results?
- What is the difference between City Hotel and Resort Hotel?

## 🧰 Tools I Used
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** — to combine tables and calculate revenue
- **Excel** — data source and check values
- **Power BI** — dashboard and visualizations
- **PDF Report** — final summary and explanation

## 📊 Main Metric
### Revenue
Revenue is calculated like this:

**Revenue = (Weekend Nights + Week Nights) × ADR**

Where:
- **ADR** = Average Daily Rate (price per night)
